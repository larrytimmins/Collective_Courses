# Collective_Courses
Location for general summaries of courses taken, reviewed


FYI - I've taken many Udemy, Pluralsight, CareerAcademy courses in addition to FreeCodeCamp and others.
-- I'll try to add links / overviews to what I have taken and/or reviewed in small batches of 2 to 6 at a time. Slow updates, but should be 'full' by June

## Shout outs to:

 - Quincy Larson (www.freecodecamp.org) Sign up for his weekly newsletter with 5 more Youtube and/or Reads for beginning developers and career changers.
 - Jeff Geerling -- the Ansible, DevOps, Kubernets master orchestrator himself.   If you follow Leanpub.com look for his Ansible for Devops, Ansible for Kubernetes.  If you uses Ansible Galaxy, you must have come across his contributions.  Jeff Geerling.  Github:  https://github.com/geerlingguy.  Great blogs
 
# Out of Scope.

For my PMP and general compliance, risk and cybersecurity efforts, I cover well over 240 hours a year on GRC, NY DFS, NIST, ISO, CMMC, SOC 2, TPRM, TPVM, MITRE, NAIC, HIPAA, PCI, HITRUST, NIST CSF, NIST RMF, CIS RAM, CIS Benchmarks, Cloud security third parties, Cloud platform security architectures, etc. -- this is not part of this Collective_Courses.  However, Baker Tilly, Venminder, Aqua Security, (Old) Rancher, ControlCase, Grey Castle, OWASP, Offensive Security, Pluralsight, Udemy, others all can be searched to see what webinars and CPE opportunities await you if interested.

Also, I tend to bounce between Go, Python, PowerShell, Bash, SQL, YAML JSON, etc. on a daily basis to automate and orchestrate wherever life takes me or I just want to convert a Go or Perl program to Python etc to keep my love of languages and data analytics sharp.
