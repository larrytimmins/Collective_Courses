# Collective_Courses
Location for general summaries of courses taken, reviewed


FYI - I've taken many Udemy, Pluralsight, CareerAcademy courses in addition to FreeCodeCamp and others.
-- I'll try to add links / overviews to what I have taken and/or reviewed in small batches of 2 to 6 at a time. Slow updates, but should be 'full' by June

## Shout outs to:

 - Quincy Larson (www.freecodecamp.org) Sign up for his weekly newsletter with 5 more Youtube and/or Reads for beginning developers and career changers.
 - Jeff Geerling -- the Ansible, DevOps, Kubernets master orchestrator himself.   If you follow Leanpub.com look for his Ansible for Devops, Ansible for Kubernetes.  If you uses Ansible Galaxy, you must have come across his contributions.  Jeff Geerling.  Github:  https://github.com/geerlingguy.  Great blogs
