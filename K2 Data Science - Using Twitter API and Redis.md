# K2 Data Science's "Build a Streaming Twitter Filter with Python and Redis"

This was a great way to do a project with python3 and redis and just enjoy the result. I have a simple UI that find my twitter topic, adds four other related ones and let's me know what's trending and what the outlook (positive, neutral, negactive) on tweets related to my choices,

I felt this was an excellent 5/5 course - provide great overview of going from concept to the design, touching on many topics (semantics, weights, etc.) for UX.

I did this course using Udemy Course.  It helped me to evaluate the instructor, K2 Data Science style overall, and to look for more Udemy offerings by this instructor.

Did I mention it was a free Udemy course?
